# MazeGeneratorSolver
<h3>3D procedural maze generator and solver</h3>
<ul>
<li>Maze generator utilizes Prim's algorithm to generate a "perfect maze" (a maze that only has one solution)</li>
<li>Maze solver utilizes a modified A* pathfinding algorithm. Algorithm was modified to better simulate if a robot were placed into the maze, it cannot go from one cell directly to another cell unless they are connected, and as such must trace its steps backwards to reach the new cell.</li>
  <li>Made in unity 2020.2.4f1</li>
</ul>
